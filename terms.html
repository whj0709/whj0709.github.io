  <div class="box">
    <p>
      This website and product are operated by <strong>Lei’s Studio</strong> (the “Operator”), an independent individual business.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>Clean Table Exporter</strong> browser extension and this website.
      By using the product, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Product description</h2>
  <p>
    Clean Table Exporter is a Chrome browser extension that helps users select and export tables (or table-like structures) from web pages
    into structured formats such as CSV or Excel.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Local processing</h2>
  <p>
    The extension runs locally in your browser. The Operator does not collect, transmit, or store your exported data on external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the extension complies with applicable laws and the terms of any website you visit.
    The Operator is not responsible for content on third-party websites.
  </p>

  <h2>4. License & Pro activation</h2>
  <p>
    The product may offer both free and paid (“Pro”) features. A one-time purchase provides a license key that unlocks Pro features.
    License activation occurs locally within the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The product is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> basis without warranties of any kind.
    The Operator does not guarantee that the extension will work on every website or with every table structure.
  </p>

  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Clean Table Exporter does not collect, transmit, or store personal data.
    All table extraction and export processing happens locally in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension may store limited local settings (for example, license status and daily usage count) using browser storage
    to support product functionality.
  </p>

  <h2 id="refund">Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Payments are processed by Paddle. Refunds are handled in accordance with Paddle’s refund policy and applicable consumer protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact Paddle support and include your order details.
