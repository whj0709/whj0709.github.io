  <h1>Terms & Policies</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-14</p>

  <!-- Paddle-required: Legal business name explicitly present in Terms -->
  <div class="box">
    <p>
      This website and the associated software product are operated by <strong>Lei’s Studio</strong>
      (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>Clean Table Exporter</strong> browser extension
      and this website. By using the product, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Product description</h2>
  <p>
    Clean Table Exporter is a Chrome browser extension that helps users select and export tables (or table-like structures)
    from web pages into structured formats such as CSV or Excel.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Local processing</h2>
  <p>
    The extension runs locally in your browser. We do not collect, transmit, or store your exported data on external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the extension complies with applicable laws and the terms of any website you visit.
    We are not responsible for content on third-party websites.
  </p>

  <h2>4. License & Pro activation</h2>
  <p>
    The product may offer both free and paid (“Pro”) features. A one-time purchase provides a license key that unlocks Pro features.
    License activation occurs within the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The product is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> basis without warranties of any kind.
    We do not guarantee that the extension will work on every website or with every table structure.
  </p>

  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Clean Table Exporter does not collect, transmit, or store personal data.
    All table extraction and export processing happens locally in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension may store limited local settings (for example, license status and daily usage count) using browser storage
    to support product functionality.
  </p>

  <h2 id="refund">Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We offer a <strong>14-day refund policy</strong> from the date of purchase.
    If you experience technical issues or the product does not function as described, please contact Paddle support within 14 days
    and include your order details so your request can be reviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Refund requests submitted after the 14-day period may not be eligible.
